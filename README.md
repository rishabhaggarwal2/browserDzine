browserDzine
============

browserDzine is a web app built for web designers and customers who wish to get their websites designed. It is inspired by Webstiles by Namanyay Goel and the idea that web designing should start in the browser itself rather than on Photoshop. Hope you like using it. It's still in its beta version so there are many more enhancements to come. Made by Rishabh Aggarwal on Diwali.
